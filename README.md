# Electron-Proton Ion Collider Benchmark Library

## Description:
- The library has been developed to standardize and automate the execution of detector benchmarks over all iterations of the ePIC design.
- Under the hood, simulations are run using npsim and eicrecon, which are contained within the eicshell container available as a stable or nightly build.
- The library contains multiple modules to support benchmark workflows, such as configuration & filesystem management, execution configuration on various systems (local, HPC, etc.), and data analytic tools
